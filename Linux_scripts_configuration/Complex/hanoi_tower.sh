#=================================================================#
#  The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle attributed to
#+ Edouard Lucas, a nineteenth-century French mathematician.
#
#  There are three vertical posts set in a base.
#  The first post has a set of annular rings stacked on it.
#  These rings are disks with a hole drilled out of the center,
#+ so they can slip over the posts and rest flat.
#  The rings have different diameters, and they stack in ascending
#+ order, according to size.
#  The smallest ring is on top, and the largest on the bottom.
#
#  The task is to transfer the stack of rings
#+ to one of the other posts.
#  You can move only one ring at a time to another post.
#  You are permitted to move rings back to the original post.
#  You may place a smaller ring atop a larger one,
#+ but *not* vice versa.
#  Again, it is forbidden to place a larger ring atop a smaller one.
#
#  For a small number of rings, only a few moves are required.
#+ For each additional ring,
#+ the required number of moves approximately doubles,
#+ and the "strategy" becomes increasingly complicated.

# Exercises:
# ---------
# 1) Would commands beyond this point ever be executed?
#    Why not? (Easy)
# 2) Explain the workings of the workings of the "dohanoi" function.
#    (Difficult -- see the Dewdney reference, above.)
